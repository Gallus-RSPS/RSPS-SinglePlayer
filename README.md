# RSPS-SinglePlayer
An archive of Mige5's 2006SinglePlayer and RS2 Progressive SinglePlayer projects.


# General Information
2006SinglePlayer (06SP) started as Orion, developed and hosted by Mige5 (Mige). After the closure of Orion, Mige began work on 06SP. The project ran successfully for a couple of years until the the project was closed, with it's final Update v3.3, dated 1-24-2021.

March 30, 2022 Mige released the first version of Progressive Singleplayer (Prog), a "continuation" (used loosely) of 06SP. Prog is a multi-revision single-player RuneScape server. It currently boasts support for 13 (that's right 13) cache revisions, dating back into 2005 (Revision 289) and ending in 2006 (Revision 377). The project has seen numerous updates throughout the year it has been in the public eye, currently sitting at v2.0.

Unfortunately, over the years, the official Discord server for the project has be disolved, however, I currently offer a dedicated community/support Discord, RSPS Central, for all those who would like to join. The server is currently at 1.3k members and growing, offering a friendly community for ready to help with support issues, as well as gathering bug reports to pass along to Mige. You can find the link to the Discord server below.
